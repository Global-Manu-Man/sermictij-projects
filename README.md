## Installation




Download and install XAMPP

- Go to the official XAMPP website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
- Download the appropriate version of XAMPP for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of XAMPP.


Starting the Apache module:

- Once you have installed XAMPP, open the XAMPP Control Panel application. On Windows, it is usually located at C:\xampp\xampp-control.exe.
- Once the XAMPP Control Panel is open, you will see a list of modules such as Apache, MySQL, etc.
- Click on the "Start" button next to the Apache module. This will start the Apache web server.


Serving your HTML project:

- Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL: http://localhost/
- If you have placed your HTML project in the htdocs folder within the XAMPP installation directory (usually C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows), you can access your project by typing the relative path to htdocs after localhost/.
- For example, if your HTML project is located at C:\xampp\htdocs\sermictij-projects, you can access it in your browser by typing http://localhost
